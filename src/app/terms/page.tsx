                Ceramic glazes are inherently variable. While we formulate each
                batch from tested recipes and strive for accurate color
                matching, you acknowledge that:

                <li>
                  Final fired color may vary based on your clay body, kiln
                  conditions, application thickness, and firing schedule
                </li>
                <li>
                  Screen colors are approximations &mdash; monitors display
                  colors differently than fired ceramics
                </li>
                <li>
                  Minor batch-to-batch variation is normal and expected in
                  ceramic glazes
                </li>
